# panelizer-cli
A CLI tool for laying out portrait or landscape images into clean, instagram-ready carousel panels. Puts images into one or more 2000×2500px (instagram-ready) portrait panels, based on image width thresholds like 16:9. Free and open-source forever - fork this or open a PR if you think of a cool new feature.
